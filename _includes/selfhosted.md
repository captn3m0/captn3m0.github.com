If you're interested in my self-hosting setup, I'm using Terraform + Docker, the code is hosted on [the same server][nebula], and I've been writing about my experience and learnings:

1. [Part 1, Hardware](/blog/2017/09/17/home-server-build/)
2. [Part 2, Terraform/Docker](/blog/2017/11/09/home-server-update/)
3. [Part 3, Learnings](/blog/2017/12/18/home-server-learnings/)
4. [Part 4, Migrating from Google (and more)](/blog/2017/12/31/migrating-from-google/)

If you have any comments, [reach out to me](/contact/)
