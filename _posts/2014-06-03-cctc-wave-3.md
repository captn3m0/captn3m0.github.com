I was winner of the Deloitte CCTC Wave I, and a finalist for the Wave II.
It was natural I was participating this year as well. While the first year
involved a simple penetration test as the first round, and it was an abstract
submission in Wave II; this time it was a closed jeopardy-style CTF contest
between different teams from various colleges.

There were altogether more than 30 teams participating in the CTF. I was lucky
to have teammates like [Abhishek Das][ad](CCTC Wave II Winner) and [Ravi Kishore][rk]
who endured through several challenges when I gave up.

We've published all challenges over on [GitHub][gh] along with writeups and problems
being made available wherever we can.

The challenges ranged from very easy to difficult to absurd trivia. We topped
the round with the most number of points across the board, making sure we got
the +30 bonus for solving first on all but 2 challenges out of 13.

We'll be leaving for Hyderabad for the finals in the first week of April. Wish us
luck, will you.

**Update**: We won the final event at Hyderabad as well. More details (and a pic) on our blog post on SDSLabs [here](https://blog.sdslabs.co/2014/05/deloitte-cctc).
