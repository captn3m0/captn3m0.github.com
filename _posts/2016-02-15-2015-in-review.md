## Reading

I started with a goal of 20 books for this year, and ended up reading about 28. Tried experimenting with Audiobooks near the year end, and failed. Bought a Kindle paperwhite as well. I tend to read a lot of Fantasy and SF, and this continued in 2015 as well. The best books I read this year (in order):

- Lions of Al Rassan [[review](https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/1241094426)]
- The Goblin Emperor [[review](https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/1400549503)]
- The Martian [[review](https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/1148506677)]

A complete list is on [Goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/user/year_in_books/2015/6170741)

## Tech

- Launched [hackercouch][hc] as a personal project.
- Shifted to Arch Linux + i3wm setup for my laptop. See [Setup](/setup/) page for more details.
- Left facebook, mostly because of their stance on Net Neutrality and the FreeBasics debacle in India.
