A lot of companies have come up with the idea for reducing all your cards into a single piece of plastic. Here's a summary of all the ones I could find, and their fate.
Beware: this field is very much a startup graveyard. The only remaining survivor seems to be Curve[^1] but it's also the first one that's attempting this outside of US.

There seem to be a lot of challenges (regulatory, financial, and technical) before such a thing becomes reality. And there's Apple/Samsung Pay as well. Here's a summary of all the companies I could find in this space.
If I've missed any, please let me know, and I'll add them here.

## [Curve](https://www.curve.com/) (2015-)

>Curve allows you to spend from any of your accounts using just one card, clearing the clutter from your wallet and simplifying your finances.

- Curve has raised a total of $74M at a valuation north of $250M, out of which Â£6M were from a crowdfunding campaign in 2019.
- Their waitlist is at 800,000+ users.
- [Curve faced flak for failing to disclose its usage numbers](https://www.businessinsider.com/curve-fintech-startup-leaked-active-users-crowdfunding-2019-11) (<100,000 monthly active users out of total 500,000) to crowdfund investors.
- Only works with Visa/MasterCard. Used to work with Amex, but Curve has a history of working and being blocked by Amex repeatedly.
- See [this page](https://support.imaginecurve.com/hc/en-gb/articles/115005783125-How-does-Curve-work-) for some details on how it works.

## Coin (YC W13) (2012-2017)

- Coin raised a total of $15.6M.
- [Shipped in 2015 April](https://techcrunch.com/2015/04/17/coin-the-one-credit-card-to-rule-them-all-is-finally-shipping/).
- [Acquired by Fitbit in May 2016](https://investor.fitbit.com/press/press-releases/press-release-details/2016/Fitbit-Inc-Acquires-Wearable-Payments-Assets-From-Financial-Technology-Company-Coin/default.aspx).
- [Shutdown by Fitbit in Feb 2017](https://techcrunch.com/2017/01/31/coin-shut-down/).
- Related: [Google acquired FitBit in 2019 Nov](https://techcrunch.com/2019/11/01/google-is-acquiring-fitbit/).

## Plastc (2014-2017)

- Single dynamic card with e-Ink touchscreen. See obligatory [launch video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8QrI3lntq3g) with fancy AR.
- Crowdfunded $9M on pre-orders in October 2014.
- Delayed launch to April 2016, and then again to September 2016.
- Shut down and declared bankruptcy in April 2017.
- [Complete story via digg.com](https://digg.com/2017/plastc-smart-card-bankruptcy-what-happened).

## Stratos (2015-2015)

- Was supposed to cost $95/year.
- [Announced May 2015](https://techcrunch.com/2015/05/26/the-stratos-all-in-one-credit-card-isnt-perfect-enough/).
- Raised $6.63 million over three rounds of financing.
- Ran out of money by [December 2015](https://techcrunch.com/2015/12/21/stratos-card-to-shut-down-just-six-months-after-launching/).
- Sold to [Ciright One](https://techcrunch.com/2015/12/22/stratos-sells-to-ciright-one-to-avoid-collapse/) to avoid collapse.
- Seems to be dead now.

## Swyp (2014-2017)

- Had a pre-order campaign in 2014.
- Raised $5M from Khosla Ventures in 2017.
- Tried to pivot in 2017, failed.
- Offered customers a [debit card with an app called Hoot](http://blog.swypcard.com/blog/swyp-card-july-update) in 2017 as an alternative to refunds. I don't think the Hoot card ever materialized.
- Tilt (Swyp's payment processor) also ceased operations in 2017, due to unrelated reasons.
- Swyp [finally shut down in December 2017](http://blog.swypcard.com/blog/swyp-card-update).

## [Final](https://www.getfinal.com/) (YC W15) (2014-2017)

- Final was with a credit card with a different number for every website. As a independent card, Final doesn't exactly fit in this list, but it's a very relevant and loved product.
- Announced itself [with a snazzy video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ZtG5DX5FR0) in mid 2014
- Raised $4M and launched in August 2016, but remained invite-only till the very end.
- Final's blog has some interesting content: A [Request for Credit Cards](https://www.getfinal.com/company-news/2017/08/21/rfcc/) program to build card-issuance backed businesses and the [Payment card landscape](https://www.getfinal.com/company-news/2017/03/30/2017-payment-card-landscape/) for 2017.
- [Shut down in december 2017](https://www.getfinal.com/company-news/2017/12/06/a-final-farewell/) and acquired [by Goldman Sachs](https://www.fastcompany.com/40523758/goldman-sachs-buys-credit-card-startup-final) in an acqui-hire.

# Indian Landscape

India hasn't seen a true single-card app yet, but there have been lots of related attempts:

- [Infino promises a single-card](https://getinfino.com/), but it hasn't launched yet. It has a [public roadmap](https://trello.com/b/2h9S100Z/the-infino-roadmap).
- IndusInd bank has [tried a dual-chip debit+credit](https://www.businesstoday.in/sectors/banks/indusind-launches-credit-cum-debit-card-confuse-customers/story/284912.html) card
- IndusInd has also [tried an interactive credit card](https://www.businesstoday.in/top-story/new-credit-card-with-buttons-gives-users-emi-options-helps-redeem-reward-points/story/290763.html) with 3 buttons.
- [FamPay](https://fampay.in/), [Fold](https://fold.money/), [Niyo](https://www.goniyo.com/), [OneCard](https://www.getonecard.app/), [Donut](https://meetdonut.com/), [vCard](https://vcard.ai/hdWorks/) [^2] and lots of other startups are doing co-branded issuance, but that's not the same thing.

With the emergence of UPI, and low penetration rate of credit cards, I don't see a market in India - but I'd love to be proven wrong.

Did I miss anything? [Reach out](/contact/) and let me know.

Thanks to [Harman](https://twitter.com/thatharmansingh) for reviewing drafts of this, and PRL for getting me interested enough to document this.

[^1]: Curve used to live on `imaginecurve.com`, then switched to `curve.app` and now to `curve.com`, which must have cost them millions.
[^2]: Unlike others on the list, vCard is entirely a virtual card, and supports UPI transfers from your credit limit.
