So I recently did a talk on Joy of Software Development. You can read more about the talk [here][talk]. This post is devoted to the references I'd promised to link to in the talk. Since it was an introductory talk, and I didn't want to bore people to death, I decided to cover lots of topics at a shallow depth, instead of covering a few topics deeply.

This means that I need to post more material for people to follow up on. So, this is that reference blog post. Make sure you have a copy of the slides open as you go through these links.

##Tests

During the talk, I decidedly used the term TDD incorrectly. TDD technically means going test first, but I used it as an introduction to testing in general. This was intentional. The links here will use TDD in the correct sense.

- [Test Driven Development Tutorial](http://code.tutsplus.com/tutorials/beginning-test-driven-development-in-python--net-30137)
- [Why TDD works](http://programmers.stackexchange.com/questions/41409/why-does-tdd-work)

- [Importance of testing](http://blog.codinghorror.com/i-pity-the-fool-who-doesnt-write-unit-tests/) - Jeff Atwood
- [Benefits of going test first](http://sd.jtimothyking.com/2006/07/11/twelve-benefits-of-writing-unit-tests-first/)
- [Testing culture at github](http://blog.leif.me/2012/09/github-testing/)
- [Source code I used in talk](https://github.com/captn3m0/talks/blob/gh-pages/josd/code/code2.js)

##REST and APIs

- [Why was REST a breakthrough](https://www.quora.com/How-did-Roy-Fieldings-introduction-of-REST-in-his-2000-doctoral-thesis-impact-the-internet)
- [A simple lucid explanation of REST](http://www.looah.com/source/view/2284)
- [What API to use](http://www.programmableweb.com/)
- [NIH Syndrome](http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?NotInventedHere)


##Unix Philosophy

- The epic [Knuth vs McIlroy](http://www.leancrew.com/all-this/2011/12/more-shell-less-egg/#fnref:pipe) story
- [Zawinski's Law](http://www.catb.org/jargon/html/Z/Zawinskis-Law.html)
- <http://onethingwell.org/>
- [Wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_philosophy) on the topic is surprisingly good
- [Good examples of pipes](http://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/30759/whats-a-good-example-of-piping-commands-together)

##Books
These are books i absolutely recommend every software developer to read, in order.

1. [Don't Make Me Think](http://blog.codinghorror.com/dont-make-me-think-second-edition/)
2. [Pragmatic Programmer](https://pragprog.com/the-pragmatic-programmer)

Other than these, I recommend reading Code Complete, Mythical Man Month, and everything by Jeff Atwood and Zach Homan, but only after you have read the above 2 books.
