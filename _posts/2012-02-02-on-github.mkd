A slide from GitHub's famous "How Github uses Github to build Github talk":

<script async class="speakerdeck-embed" data-id="4e79b461c9bdcb003f00331d" data-ratio="1.33333333333333" data-slide="10" src="//speakerdeck.com/assets/embed.js"></script>

In their recent version of the talk at RubyConf 2011, they changed the slide slightly:

![No pings](/img/rubyconf-github.png)

It now reads, "No Pings" instead of "No Managers".

Not nitpicking, just paying attention.

If you haven't seen the talk (or just saw the slideshow), you should go and watch the talk (31 mins) [Right Now](https://confreaks.tv/videos/rubymidwest2011-how-github-uses-github-to-build-github)
