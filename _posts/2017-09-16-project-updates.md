Over the last couple of years, I've been involved with lots of side projects, both online and offline. Some of them, I've written about on the blog, like my [music visualizer project][spectrumyzer]. A few of them, got their own project page, like [the website for my niece][shauryaa] (but no blog post) while some didn't even get a mention. I thought I'd write about the many-many side projects I've started (and abandoned). You might also wanna visit the [/projects](/projects/) page for the larger projects.

[Home Server Build][home-server]
: **Sep 2017** Built a home server, mostly as a HTPC but also as a learning exercise for managing services over Docker.

[Sushi Go][sushigo]
: **Summer 2017** This is a work-in-progress conversion of Sushi Go (original), the popular card game by Gamewright into Ruby.

[youtube-ripper][ytripper]
: **June 2017** Downloads music-compilations from YouTube and rips them into multiple tagged MP3 files. 

[cosmere-books][cosmere]
: **September 2017** Wrote a EPUB generator for multiple books in the Cosmere. Currently covers 4 different serializations at Tor.com. Also created a project page on all of my ebooks projects at [/ebooks/](/ebooks/)

[ideas][ideas]
: **Ongoing** I maintain a CC0 licensed list of personal ideas. Feel free to use.

[spectrumyzer][spectrumyzer]
: **May 2017** Created an animated wallpaper using spectrumyzer. Wrote a [blog post about it](/blog/2017/05/01/spectrumyzer-visualization/).

[google-sre][sre]
: **Feb/Sep 2017** EPUB generator for the Google SRE ebook. Started in February in Python. Gave up and redid it properly in September.

[CodeChef Offline][codechef]
: **March 2012** I attempted to make a offline repository for CodeChef problems. I spent some time in May 2017 upgrading the project with a cleaner scraper and a Jekyll base. 

[Hoshruba][hoshruba]
: **June 2015** I wrote a script that scraped Tor's serialized publication of the first book in Hoshruba series to generate EPUB and MOBI files. I would recommend the book if you are interested in reading what many would term the "original fantasy book"

[HackerTray][hackertray]
: **December 2013 -** I wrote a Linux PyGTK application that sits in your taskbar using Indicator Applet to show you the latest stories from Hacker News. Looking for a maintainer.

[MagicMuggle][magicmuggle]
: **May 2017** I wrote a script to convert Magic Muggle (A Harry Potter fanfic about a muggle who accidentally gets into Hogwarts) books from their original reddit posts to EPUB and MOBI files.

[Kerala IT Policy][kerala-it]
: **March 2017** Attempted to transcribe the draft IT policies put up by the Government of Kerala. Lots of OCR followed by manual fixes. I stopped working on this when I realized that the government had actually put up a really nice website for this (with clear plaintext, not the bad PDF I was using as the source). 

[lightsaber][lightsaber]
: **August 2015** I created a DNS based HTTP-3xx redirect service. Useful if you own a domain and you want it to be redirected, but don't have a webserver with you. Made as part of the Django Hackathon organized by HackerEarth in Ruby.

[HackerCouch][hackercouch]
: **November 2015** My hack during hackbeach 2015. Created something best described as "couchsurfing for hackers". Simple Jekyll/Ruby website hosted on GitHub Pages.
