I tweeted this a while back about my reading progress in 2016, and thought I'd do a post about what I read.

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Made a graph of my <a href="https://twitter.com/goodreads">@goodreads</a> reading progress in 2016. I only picked up the pace sometime in May, but managed to read ~10k pages this year.</p>

Continuing with the [review tradition from last year](/blog/2016/02/15/2015-in-review/), here are the top 3 books that I read in 2016:

- [The Library at Mount Char](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/26892110-the-library-at-mount-char) [[review](https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/1648561385?book_show_action=false&from_review_page=1)]
- [Binti](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25667918-binti) (Hugo winner for Best Novella, SF)
- [Lolita](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/7604.Lolita)

Other books that I enjoyed were "Bands of Mourning", the 3rd book in Mistborn Era 2, and the Powder Mage Trilogy which I found hard to put down.

I decided to aim for 36 books in 2016 (as well as 2017 now), and crossed that nicely. I picked 36 because it corresponds to 3 books a month or 1 book every 10 days, which makes for a goal that is easily tracked. I count everything that goodreads might count as a book (which is both good and bad), but I stick to it. Far more important for me would be the page count, which I charted at the end of the year and I read ~830 pages a month, which I'm pretty happy with.

I'm hoping to read more technical books in 2017, and have made some progress on that front with re-reading [SICP](https://sarabander.github.io/sicp/).
