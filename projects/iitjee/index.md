title: IIT-JEE  Results
permalink: /projects/iitjee/
---

This page will contain the latest information and developments on the IIT-JEE Results. The entire resultset is available for download and is searchable as well.

I do not like the concept of "search by name", or such listings. I am more of an archival person, and feel that large datasets such as these should be made freely available. Some of these links (those on
SDSLabs JEE site) may include a search-by-name feature.

Most of the source code used to gather these datasets is available [on github](https://github.com/captn3m0/iitjee/). It is released under MIT Licence. Feel free to use it for further work. There is also a [blog post titled "How I got the complete IITJEE result list"](https://medium.com/i-did-this/how-i-got-the-complete-iitjee-result-list-39a9ad44ddd1) if you'd like to read more about the process and the story behind this work.

## 2016

- Results are available at [jeedata.github.io](https://jeedata.github.io/mains2016)
- I have no idea who published these, but I'm told they are genuine and correct.

## 2015

- Results are available at [jee.sdslabs.co](https://jee.sdslabs.co/index2.html)

## 2014

- Results are available at [jee.sdslabs.co](https://jee.sdslabs.co/2014/)

## 2013

- Results are available at [jee.sdslabs.co](https://jee.sdslabs.co/2013/)
- Some graphs are available at [jee.sdslabs.co/graph/2013](https://jee.sdslabs.co/graph/2013.html)

## 2012

- I have uploaded the list at [jee.sdslabs.co](https://jee.sdslabs.co/2012/). Some statistics and pretty graphs are available [here](https://jee.sdslabs.co/2012/graph/)
- For sake of backups, and archival, I'm also keeping a copy of the list [here](2012.html). However, please forward all issues regarding this to the SDSLabs site, I will be able to better handle it there.
- I also have lots of complementary data to this dataset (such as that on Application Form Numbers). I am not uploading this data right now (at least till the allotments are over). Someone please remind me to do so after they are done with. I'm sure people would find it interesting.

## 2011

- View [Results Online](/projects/iitjee/2011.html)
- Or Download it in [csv](/projects/iitjee/2011.html) [ods](/projects/iitjee/2011.ods) [xlsx](/projects/iitjee/2011.xlsx) formats.
- A list of center-wise selection count is available [here](https://captnemo.in/projects/iitjee/center.html)
- This list lacks some information (such as the application form numbers). I have since then lost my database backup, otherwise I would have uploaded it.

## 2010

- View [Results Online](https://captnemo.in/projects/iitjee/2010.html) (2.3 MB, might take some time to load)
- Or Download it in [csv](https://captnemo.in/projects/iitjee/2010.csv) and [sql](https://captnemo.in/projects/iitjee/2010.sql) formats
- A list of selection count is available [here](https://captnemo.in/projects/iitjee/2010.center.html). This count is based on the first three digits of the registration number, which I've since learned is not how it works. As such it is not-completely-correct. (The correct versioning scheme uses the first four digits of the registration number to denote the actual center (within a city)).

## 2009

I was the first person to do such a listing, and since my first such list was in 2010 (posted on the now defunct piratecoders.co.cc), after my second semester in college, I fear there are very few archives of such things before that date. However, a JEE panel had analysed the results of the year 2009, and they were made available on the [IIT JEE website](http://jee.iitr.ernet.in/images/jee2009.mdb) (38MB).

**Update**: JEE took down that file, and I've luckily setup a mirror [here](https://jmp.sh/v/HoV2bHW1zDULe4FtDwWn). The file is an Access Database and you'd need MS Access to open it, but I have a csv and PDF (both official versions) of the same as well. The dataset seems to have been released as result of a RTI application available [here on the jee site](http://jee.iitr.ernet.in/images/SG-06112009-10.pdf), and [archived by me](SG-06112009-10.pdf) as well. I can't seem to find the pdf with the results analysis. If anyone finds such a thing, please let me know.

- Download the [Official marks list PDF file](https://jmp.sh/v/R3YeZko2gkeZ4P2Xkk4N). (13,276 pages)
- Download the [Official marks list csv file](https://jmp.sh/v/yRUSJrnw3bzGGNf0jL3A).
- Download the [Official jee2009 database](https://jmp.sh/v/HoV2bHW1zDULe4FtDwWn) (MS Access format).

# Licence Information

## 2009

The data is from the IIT-JEE website. I have only mirrored it, because the JEE website no longer hosts it.

Since it was released under RTI, I do not hold any rights over the dataset.
