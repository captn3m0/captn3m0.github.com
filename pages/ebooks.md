A fun side-project that I often pick up is generation of semantically correct EPUB/MOBI/PDF files from various online books and content. This is a short list:

[Oathbringer][cosmere]
: Chapters 0-32 from Oathbringer, Book 3 in the Stormlight Archive, being published by Tor in serialized format. (ongoing)

[Way of Kings Reread][cosmere]
: Tor's re-read of Way of kings, Book 1 in the Stormlight Archive.

[Words of Radiance Reread][cosmere]
: Tor re-read of Words of Radiance, Book 2 in the Stormlight Archive.

[Oathbringer Reread][cosmere]
: Tor re-read of Oathbringer, Book 3 in the Stormlight Archive.

[Edgedancer Reread][cosmere]
: Tor re-read of Edgedancer, a novella between Books 2 & 3 in the Stormlight Archive.

[Way of Kings Prime][cosmere]
: Brandaon Sanderson published a few chapters from the earliest draft of Way of Kings (2002, while the book was published almost a decade later).

[Hoshruba][hoshruba]
: Tor's serialized publication of Hoshruba-The Land and the Tilism.

[Magic Muggle][mm]
: Harry Potter fan-fiction about a muggle going to Hogwarts. (3rd book ~~ongoing~~ abandoned)

[Site Reliability Engineering][sre]
: Google's book on Site Reliability Engineering. Published by Google as a online read under CC BY-NC-ND 4.0

[The Site Reliability Workbook][sre]

[Security Engineering â€” Third Edition][se3] by Ross Anderson [[source](https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~rja14/book.html)]
: Comprised of the third-edition, currently under review PDFs. Only available till it goes to press.

Things next on my list:

-   <https://www.tor.com/series/warbreaker-reread-brandon-sanderson/>
-   White Sand (From .doc to EPUB)
-   <https://www.tor.com/series/malazan-reread-of-the-fallen/>
-   <https://www.tor.com/series/a-read-of-ice-and-fire/>
-   <https://www.tor.com/series/jonathan-strange-mr-norrell-reread/>

I only provide the scripts for the generation on GitHub. If you'd like a copy without having to run the script, [get in touch][contact] and ask.

I also have a short script (node.js) that helps me generate EPUB files from URLs easily: <https://www.npmjs.com/package/url-to-epub>.

-   <https://doocer.com>, which generates EPUB/MOBI files out of RSS/ATOM feeds, and given a TOC. Pretty cool
-   [Calibre Recipes](https://manual.calibre-ebook.com/news_recipe.html), which are similar but mostly focused on news websites instead of online books.

As a side-effect, I often get into the rabbit hole of generating the perfect EPUB instead of actually reading them.
