A fun side-project that I often pick up is generation of semantically correct EPUB/MOBI/PDF files from various online books and content. This is a short list:

[Oathbringer][cosmere]
: Chapters 0-62 from Oathbringer, Book 3 in the Stormlight Archive, being published by Tor in serialized format. (ongoing)

[Way of Kings Reread][cosmere]
: Tor's re-read of Way of kings, Book 1 in the Stormlight Archive.

[Words of Radiance Reread][cosmere]
: Tor re-read of Words of Radiance, Book 2 in the Stormlight Archive.

[Hoshruba][hoshruba]
: Tor's serialized publication of Hoshruba-The Land and the Tilism

[Magic Muggle][mm]
: Harry Potter fan-fiction about a muggle going to Hogwarts. (3rd book ongoing)

[Google SRE][sre]
: Google's book on Site Reliability Engineering. Published by google as a online read.

Things next on my list:

- https://www.tor.com/series/warbreaker-reread-brandon-sanderson/
- https://www.tor.com/series/edgedancer-reread-brandon-sanderson/
- White Sand (From .doc to EPUB)
- https://www.tor.com/series/malazan-reread-of-the-fallen/
- https://www.tor.com/series/a-read-of-ice-and-fire/
- https://www.tor.com/series/jonathan-strange-mr-norrell-reread/

I only provide the scripts for the generation on GitHub. If you'd like a copy without having to run the script, [get in touch][contact] and ask.

As a side-effect, I often get into the rabbit hole of generating the perfect EPUB instead of actually reading them.
