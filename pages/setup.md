## Who am I, and what do I do?

I'm Abhay Rana, more popularly known as Nemo. I am a hacker, web developer, writer, and a UX enthusiast. ~~I am working on a book called [The Joy of Software Development][josd].~~

I do tech and security related things at [Razorpay](https://razorpay.com).

I run [HackerCouch](https://hackercouch.com/), which is like couchsurfing for hackers and [other projects](/projects/).

## What hardware do I use?

![My current home setup](/img/battlestation-shire.jpg)

Most of my work is done on my [Intel NUC (7th Gen, i7)][nuc]. My work laptop is a [Dell XPS 13][xps].

My primary phone is a [iPhone SE][se]. I use an old Moto Z Play as my secondary phone for my work. I backup all of my media to my home server (NextCloud). Other than this, I own a [Kindle Paperwhite][pw3]. For my music, I have a pair of [Jaybird X3][jaybird], alongside the noise-cancelling [Sennheiser HD 4.50][btnc].

I own a [Leopold FC660C][fc660c] keyboard (Topre switches) which I use at work (quieter). My keyboard at home is a [Cooler Master QuickFire Rapid-i][quickfire] mechanical keyboard (Cherry MX Brown). I have a [dual][curved]-[monitor][lguw] setup at home ~~and a Dell Ultrasharp at work~~. I am an ocassional gamer and use the [Logitech G300s][g300s] at both work and office (its [heavily customizable][ratslap]). I also have a [Steam Controller][steamcontroller] and a few more [fancy][airmouse] [keyboards][riitech] for my HTPC.

At home, I have a Raspberry Pi 4 and a PC/HomeServer, which runs lots of tiny services, which are proxied over to the internet with a Digital Ocean droplet in the `BLR1` region. I wrote about it in [detail][homeserver]. The Pi is used for few Kubernetes experiments.

I am also a speedcuber; my primary cube is a stickerless Gans 356 R (Magnetic). I also own several other twisty puzzles, including a Axis Cube and a Megaminx.

## Homeserver

I self-host a lot of things, and my homeserver runs Arch with lots of disks on RAID1. Total usable space is currently around 12TB, and I use it for all sort of things. The server runs [steamos-compositor-plus](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/steamos-compositor-plus/) and Kodi as the session manager. With [SteamPlay/Proton](https://store.steampowered.com/steamplay), almost everything in my library is playable on Linux, and it makes for a great console. Hardware details are at </setup/homeserver/>.

## And what software?

My distro for the last 4 years is [Arch Linux][arch] with [i3][i3] as the window manager. My most used tools include: [Neovim][neovim], [Sublime Text 3][sublime], Firefox, and Git. I game using Steam, and purchase DRM free games via Humble Bundle whenever possible. The above animated wallpaper runs via [spectrumyzer][wallpaper-blog].

Most of my work is done in editors, command line, and the browser. A few essential extensions on my browser include: [dotjs][.js] (with apache support), [Privacy Badger][privacybadger], [uBlock Origin][ublock], HTTPS Everywhere, and Markdown Here. I manage my passwords using [pass][pass].

I am a [Hacker News][hn] addict, and have even [written an application][hackertray] for it. Most used webapps would be: Slack, GitHub. I use [Gonic][gonic]/[play:sub][playsub] for listening to music on the go, and Clementine on the desktop. My security setup (passwords/2FA etc) is documented [here][security].

I run lots of tiny services on my homeserver, including [Gitea][gitea], OpenVPN, Emby, and Grafana. I have my Kindle jailbroken and run [KOReader][koreader] that lets me read EPUBs.

## What would be my dream setup?

A lightweight laptop with tons of battery life, 13" display, and official Linux support (Dell XPS13 DE comes close).

If we're talking super-crazy, I'd love to have a thought-dictation feature. That would help _a lot_ with my writing.
