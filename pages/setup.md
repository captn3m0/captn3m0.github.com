## Who am I, and what do I do?

I'm Abhay Rana, more popularly known as Nemo. I am a hacker, web developer, writer,
and a UX enthusiast. ~~I am working on a book called [The Joy of Software Development][josd].~~

I do tech and security related things at [Razorpay](https://razorpay.com).

I run [HackerCouch](https://hackercouch.com/), which is like couchsurfing for hackers.

## What hardware do I use?

![My current home setup](/img/battlestation.jpg)

Most of my work is done on my Macbook Air 2015 running Arch Linux. My personal laptop is a [System76 Galgago Pro][galago].

My primary phone is a [iPhone SE][se]. I use a Nokia 105 as my secondary phone for my work. I backup all of my media to my home server. Other than this, I own a [Kindle Paperwhite][pw3]. For my music, I have a pair of [Jaybird X3][jaybird], which I sometimes use.

I own a [Leopold FC660C][fc660c] keyboard (Topre switches) which I use at home. My keyboard at work is a [Cooler Master QuickFire Rapid-i][quickfire] mechanical keyboard (Cherry MX Brown). I have a [dual][curved]-[monitor][lguw] setup at home and a Dell Ultrasharp at work. I am an ocassional gamer and use the [Logitech G300s][g300s] at both work and office (its [heavily customizable][ratslap]). I also have a [Steam Controller][steamcontroller] and a few more [fancy][riitech] [keyboards][logitechbt] for my HTPC.

At home, I have a Raspberry Pi 2 Model B and a PC/HomeServer, which runs lots of tiny services, which are proxied over to the internet with a Digital Ocean droplet in the `BLR1` region. I wrote about it in [detail][homeserver].

I am also a speedcuber; my primary cube is a GuoGuan YueXiao Pro (stickerless). I also own several
other twisty puzzles, including a Axis Cube and a Megaminx.

## And what software?

My distro for the last 4 years is [Arch Linux][arch] with [i3][i3] as the window manager. My most used tools include: [Neovim][neovim], [Sublime Text 3][sublime], Firefox Beta, and Git. I game using Steam, and purchase DRM free games via Humble Bundle whenever possible. The above animated wallpaper runs via [spectrumyzer][wallpaper-blog].

Most of my work is done in editors, command line, and the browser. A few essential extensions on my browser include: [dotjs][.js] (with apache support), [Privacy Badger][privacybadger], [uBlock Origin][ublock], HTTPS Everywhere, and Markdown Here. I manage my passwords using [pass][pass].

I am a [Hacker News][hn] addict, and have even [written an application][hackertray] for it. Most used webapps would be: Slack, GitHub. I use [AirSonic][airsonic]/[play:sub][playsub] for listening to music on the go, and `cmus` on the desktop.

I run lots of tiny services on my homeserver, including [Gitea][gitea], OpenVPN, Emby, and Grafana. I have my Kindle jailbroken and run [KOReader][koreader] to read EPUB files and PDFs with reflow.

## What would be my dream setup?

A lightweight laptop with tons of battery life, 13" display, and official Linux support (Dell XPS13 DE comes close).

If we're talking super-crazy, I'd love to have a thought-dictation feature. That would help _a lot_ with my writing.
