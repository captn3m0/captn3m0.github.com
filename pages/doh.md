Alongside my [DNSCrypt Server](/dnscrypt/), I'm also running a DoH Server at <https://doh.captnemo.in>. The IP Address for the server is `139.59.48.222`, and is expected to never change.

## Uptime

This is currently considered `alpha`. It is expected to be up at all times aside for scheduled and emergency maintainence. I do not recommend this for Enterprise usage.

The [planned uptime is 99.99%](https://uptime.is/four-nines). There is no SLA provided, since this is a personal service.

You can monitor the uptime of the same at [status.captnemo.in](https://status.captnemo.in/).
