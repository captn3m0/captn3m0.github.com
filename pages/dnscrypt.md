I have a DNSCrypt server running out of a Digital Ocean droplet in BLR1 region. If you are within India, this might be a nice DNS server to use. Runs with DNSCrypt support, and uses [OpenDNS](https://use.opendns.com/) resolvers as the upstream.

Connection details are:

```
ProviderName    2.dnscrypt-cert.captnemo.in 
ProviderKey     053A:DFF2:C5A3:2916:D81A:D88A:6779:2C30:2BAA:D5D2:8032:95E8:5A9B:D22F:8687:1E10
ResolverAddress 139.59.48.222:4434
```

The IP address itself is static and assigned via a Digital Ocean Floating IP. You can monitor the uptime of the same at [status.captnemo.in](https://status.captnemo.in/).
