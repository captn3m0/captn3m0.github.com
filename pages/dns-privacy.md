## CHANGELOG

| :--------- | :---------------------- |

## tl;dr

Your data is not logged by default. If it has to be logged, it will be deleted within 24 hours. No queries or respones are modified, and no domains are blocked or filtered. If law enforcement forces me to do anything of the above, the [block list](/dns/blocked.txt) will be updated, along with an Annual Transparency Report. Your data (even anonymized or aggregate) will never be sold or shared with another third party.

## Privacy

1. No user data (identifiable or aggregate) will be retained beyond 24 hours.
2. Identifiable user data may me retained for upto 24 hours. This includes data associated with user IP addresses.
3. User data in any form (identifiable or aggregate) will not be retained, sold, or transferred to any third party.
4. The resolver does not combine the data it collects with any other offering or service.
5. No entity or person will be granted any rights to the collected user data.
6. The resolver supports DNS Query Name Minimization as defined in RFC 7816.
7. The client subnet DNS extension is disabled on the resolver. This means that your IP Address or your Subnet information is not transmitted to the upstream resolver that is used.

## Transparency

The privacy policy for te resolver is publicly published at <https://captnemo.in/dns/privacy>. Any changes to this policy will be documented here, and communicated in advance to the Mozilla Trusted Recursive Resolver Program.

3. Type and Number of user data requests answered from Law Enforcement, if any.

- [2018](/dns/2018/transparency.html)

# Blocking and Modification

- The resolver by default will not block or filter any domains.
- The resolver operates in the Karnataka State Jurisdiction of India, and may be specifically required by law to block or filter specific domains.
- Any domains blocked or filtered because of law enforcement requests will be listed at [/dns/blocked.txt](/dns/blocked.txt).
- The domain blocklist above will maintain a log of when particular domains are added and removed from the blocklist. It will also document which resolver the block applies to, and if possible (to the extent allowed by law), publish the corresponding Law Enforcement order.
- Accurate `NXDOMAIN` responses for absent domains will be provided.

# Operating Principles

I (Abhay Rana) run this resolver with your Privacy and Security in mind. I'm an InfoSec professional with enough experience to do this safely. The resolver runs out of [Digital Ocean Bangalore Region][do], which is colocated with [NetMagic IT Services Private Limited][nm] in [Electronic City Bangalore][ecity]. The Data Center is both SOC1 and SOC2 certified.

The resolver is co-located on a Droplet that runs a few other personal webservices.

The objectives of the resolver:

1. Maintaining security of the Infrastructure hosting it.
2. Upholding privacy of the users using it.
3. Being transparent about its operations.
4. While running within Indian Jurisdiction.
