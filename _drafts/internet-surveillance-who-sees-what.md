This blog post is a response to a very common question I hear: Who can see what I'm browsing on the Internet? While the premise of the question is very simple, the internet is large and diverse, and the answer depends on a lot of factors. The primary 2 being:

1.  Who are you connecting to? (Is it a website? A person?)
2.  How are you connecting to it? (Over a mobile app? WAP? HTTPS? EMail?)
3.  Who's your ISP?
4.  What's your network configuration?

This is going to be a somewhat long blog post, as I want to be exhaustive and cover as much information as possible.

Let us look at the most common configuration first, HTTPS websites over the Internet using a mobile browser. We'll take an example of `wikipedia.org`.

This is going to be a somewhat long blog post, as I want to be exhaustive and cover as much information as possible. We'll take wikipedia as the example website, and a few more assumptions:

1.  No censorship
2.  TBD

Let us look at the most common configuration first, HTTPS websites over the Internet using a mobile browser.
