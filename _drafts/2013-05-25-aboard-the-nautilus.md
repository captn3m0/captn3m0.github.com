I'd done a [post](http://captnemo.in/blog/2009/12/04/nautilus-behind-the-curtains/) on this a long time back (2009), detailing
what all softwares I use on a daily basis. This
is an update to that post.

Since the last post, I've moved on to using Linux, using
Ubuntu as my primary OS. The desktop shell of my
choice right now is OpenBox, as it offers me
a perfect balance of speed and control. I'm thinking of switching
to Arch Linux, just to get a faster experience. I use
Synapse as my application launcher, because its much faster
than anything else out there.

For most of my web browsing needs, I rely on Google Chrome Stable
and a daily build of Chromium (v30 as of now) for most of my work.
 I switch between them all the time. I use Firefox (stable) only to
test out my projects from time to time.

The current editor I use is Sublime Text. It is
everything you need, and much more. I'm still to
get started using its build system, and its
plethora of packages; but its still an excellent
choice for a daily use editor. On the command line, I use
Vim, git (with [SCM Breeze][scm]), [fasd][fasd] and [tig][tig],
which is an excellent git interface on the command line.

I listen to music on my own browser-based music
player, called [Muzi][muzi], YouTube and GrooveShark.

For my terminal needs, I use Gnome-Terminal. I use
[Byobu][byobu] to manage my session, and often
connect to it from other computers as well. Its an
excellent multiplexer that fits in my workflow
really well.

I use [Imo.im][imo] on both the
Desktop and my tablet to chat. I occasionally use [ReText][retext]
for editing markdown files. I also use [RedShift][rs] on my laptop and [f.lux][flux]
on my iPad to help me sleep better. I recommend it to everyone who is
suffering from eye-strain or wants to sleep better.

On the browser, my most visited sites would be
[Hacker News][hn] (via hckrnews.com), [WorkFlowy][wf] for managing
my to-do list and GitHub on a daily basis for most of my projects.

##Hardware
I own a old Nokia 7210, and will be upgrading to a [Firefox OS Phone][fos] soon enough. I use a Dell Inspiron 1545 as my personal machine. I also use an iPad 2 (with 3G) on a daily basis (mostly for reading). I also own a Dayan Zhanchi 3x3 and a 5x5 shengshou
speed cube.

##iPad Apps
The must have iPad apps for me are Chrome, [imo][imop],  and iBooks. I have installed [Mailbox][mb] alongside GMail, and haven't used GMail since
I installed it. I sometimes write stuff using [Plaintext][pt], and sketch using [Paper][paper]. I read my RSS feeds using Newsify and Feedly.

##Extensions
Chrome Extensions that I use on a daily basis include [Chimeapp][chime] for
wonderful notifications, [Ghostery][ghostery] for getting a tracker-free internet
, [HTTPS Everywhere][httpse] to keep me secure, [LastPass][lp] to manage passwords and [Stylish][stylish] for [customizing](http://userstyles.org/users/183835) the looks of various websites.
