Why are Payments so hard on the Internet? I've had a front-row at Razorpay working on all the innovation (and the legacy) that runs digital payments across the world. There's lots of different facets to this loaded question, but I want to cover a few that I think are really important and are often missed by the new-age fintech/crypto crowds. Note that this is just covering "payments", not "securities/crypto/finance" in general

# Payments

Payments are the backbone of all commerce. You get goods or services in exchange of your money. In the real world, this is how payments worked:

1. You sign a instrument issued by your bank that authorizes another party to withdraw money from your bank account. Banks at both end take a cut. (A Cheque)
2. You sign an instrument that is equivalent to cash by deducting money from your bank account. You can hand it to anyone, and they can exchange that for cash. (A Demand Draft)
3. You go a Money-Transfer-Agent, which takes your money, and provides it to the other party on showing some proof. (Western Union)
4. You provide your card, which is embossed so that the business can take a copy of your card (it is much easier than writing it down), note your spend against it - and ask your credit company for the money once-a-day.
5. You can pay in cash.
6. You can pay in gift cards, assuming that the other party accepts them.
7. A specific instrument called "PPI" (Pre-Payment-Instrument) lets you accept

This is assuming an "internet-less" world.

# Internet Equality

A core tenet of the internet is that all systems are equal - the internet makes no distinction between businesses, customers, creators, or publishers. The two core "ownable" components of the Internet: IP Addresses and Domains are issued to both Individuals as well as Businesses. There have been some places where this has been broken (see EV certificates), but by and large - an Individual is treated the same as a business.

# Regulations

In the list of payment instruments that we saw earlier, everything other than cash had this interesting property of being a closed-loop instrument. A payment instrument is usually classified in one of 3 ways:

1. Open
2. Closed
3. Semi-open

An "open" instrument is something that doesn't have any restrictions on where it can be spent. Cash is the most obvious example, but crypto-currencies are another. An open instrument cannot be tracked (by its very definition), and more importantly - Individuals can accept this for goods/services. Taxing an open-instrument as a consequence is quite hard, which is why regulators like to keep this to a minimum.

A "closed" instrument is something that can only be spent at one destination. Examples would be arcade coins, or gift cards against a specific retailer (Apple). When the retailer is large enough (say Amazon), these often become a currency of choice for criminals because redeeming a stolen gift card gives plausible deniability to its origins. Ultimately by and large, the failure domain of a closed instrument is restricted to a single business. It is in Amazon's best interest to ensure that their gift card issuance system is secure, otherwise - they lose money.

A semi-open (or semi-closed) instrument is one where things get interesting. Such an instrument can be redeemed across multiple parties _as long as they are registered_ against the redemption queue. This involves KYC/AML regulations against the acquiring bank.

While the "core infrastructure" of the Internet still very much follows the "open instrument" model (I can register )
