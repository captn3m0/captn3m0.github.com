title: Technology Dystopia?

The fact that software is eating the world is well established by now. I've increasingly become dis-heartened by the way the tech industry has grown over the last 2 decades though, and this post is a reflection of the bleak reality that we've gotten ourselves into. I wish it wasn't as bad as it is, and this post is mostly going to be highlighting the negatives - so let this stand as a guiding post for where we stand. Things might get better, who knows? I don't have much hope.

Disclaimers: Left leaning libertarian views. I work at a soonicorn payment startup.

## Ad-Tech

Ad-Tech has taken over the world. The WWW was invented as a knowledge-sharing platform. After the dotcom bubble burst, we were left with media as the primary flagbearer of the WWW. Without any easy business-models for digital content-creation, digital advertising is pretty much the only guaranteed way of making money on the internet with your content. While the web still has all the tiny websites, and the blogs from Web 1.0; they are increasingly getting thwarted by larger websites. The majority of the content on the internet happens to be hosted by maybe 5 websites? (Facebook/Twitter/Google). 

Ad-Tech has made it profitable to create content, but at the loss of agency of the reader. We are tracked everywhere, and adtech companies don't seem to care. The fines and regulations don't seem to be helping, and only making their status-quo more pronounced. Loading a single article from buzzfeed requires XXX trackers from XXX different companies. The algorithms optimizing for ad-revenue don't have ethics and will gladly make you binge watch on conspiracy videos because that drives the highest engagement.

Ad-Tech monopolies have resulted in companies being forced to advertise on media they wouldn't have needed before. The search-engine monopoly means that Google becomes both the gatekeeper and the toll-collector for the internet. Ad-Tech is the reason SEO bullshit exists. If you've ever wondered why all companies on the internet have mundane blogs that talk about seemingly-related but-not-really-relevant content - SEO is why. The whole of the SEO industry needs to die in a fire, but since that won't happen - companies will forever be forced to pay the SEO-tax and spend money/time on bullshit.

Even if you're a happy business that doesn't need digital advertising, Google will gladly take money from your competitors and show them ads when people search for your website. The road to running a business on the internet has multiple-toll-booths and you must pay Google/Facebook their dues even if you don't need their help.

Ad-tech is too big to fail. 98% of Google's revenue comes from showing Ads, and optimising this requires a large ecosystem of data-brokers, ad-exchanges, real-time-bidding systems, invasive trackers that fingerprint and track your every click.

## Freedom

If you were lucky enough to buy a computer in the previous millenium - chances are you got the source code for it. In the last 2 decades, 2 things have happened:

1. Our devices have become increasingly powerful, thanks to Moore's Law
2. They have limited your freedom to do things.

The computing revolution was led by the idea of a "Personal Computer" - a machine that could take on different roles depending on what you wanted it to be. It was the greatest technological advancement of the 21st century and yet we've never had devices that were so restricted. A few examples:

1. You can't buy Audiobooks on the Audible application on iOS, because Apple demands a 30% tax for any digital goods purchased on the device. Amazon doesn't want to pay this, so __SHRUG__. The same applies for Kindle eBooks on iOS. [^1]
2. Mobile devices increasingly come with tracking applications, bloatware, and spyware that you can't uninstall easily.
3. 


There was a time when computers would boot straight to a BASIC prompt, waiting for you to type in the code that would run on it. The device in your pocket can "emulate" that entire computer in a browser, but won't let you run the same code directly.

### DRM

Segue into DRM - Digital Rights Management. A lot of other good reads already exist on the matter, but suffice to say that DRM neither works, nor is consumer-friendly. 

## Platforms and Ownership

As "platforms" have risen on the internet, the creators have gotten screwed over. Youtube makes money from advertisers, not creators; so advertisers have the upper hand in the Content-ID system that lets them file copyright claims on records hundreds of years old. Medium has made it clear that any content you post on their website is theirs to tamper with, and they will make it increasingly hostile for your readers unless you pay them. The death of platforms like Google Plus, Tumblr, Orkut has made it clear that your content isn't really on-the-internet. It could go away anytime that the platform chooses.

Digital Ownership is on the decline. XXX% of all mail is sent between 3 domain names.

## Government Surveillance

While Tech giants are the major reason for getting us here, they aren't the only one. We have governments that looked at the future of technology and decided to do all sorts of crazy things:

1. Tap underground sea cables to intercept all communications
2. Setup listening posts on all telco offices
3. Decide to collect the DNA and Fingerprints of every resident in the country, and let people die if they couldn't.
4. Listen to inter-data-center communication to profile every person on the internet
5. Use facial recognition on entire cities, and use gait recognition where it fails.
6. Block internet access indiscriminately
7. Force all residents of their country to break encryption

# What can you do?

1. Block Ads. Make it unprofitable for ad companies to make money by just tracking you everywhere. Install a Ad-blocker on all your devices. Your internet browsing will be both more-secure and much-faster as a result.
2. Run devices that respect your freedom. Your personal computer is yours and nobody else should have control over what your processor can or cannot do.
3. Encrypt Everything. Use a E2E chat application. (ie, not Telegram or SMS)
4. Own your digital footprint. Run email on your own domain, and switch to fastmail. If I know you, I'll gladly run mail for free for you. Run your website on your own domain, and not on medium.com.
5. Use Firefox, or maybe Brave.
